To setup the environment for React.js
`npx create-react-app my-app`

This step is not necessary 
`cd my-app
cd src

# If you're using a Mac or Linux:
rm -f *

# Or, if you're on Windows:
del *

# Then, switch back to the project folder
cd ..`

Add a file named index.css in the src/ folder with this CSS code.

Add a file named index.js in the src/ folder with this JS code.

Add these three lines to the top of index.js in the src/ folder:

`import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';`

Now if you run npm start in the project folder and open http://localhost:3000 in the browser, you should see an empty tic-tac-toe field.
